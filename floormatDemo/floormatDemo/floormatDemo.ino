 RobotGeek Floormat Demo
 
 This example demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP) to read from
 a floormat switch. The code reads digital input on pin 2 and turns
 Digital Pin 4 HIGH when pin 2 goes LOW.
 
 The circuit: 
 Digital pin 2 -  Floomat switch
 Digital pin 4 - LED / Buzzer / Relay / Powertail Switch
 
 Since a raw switch like a floormat leaves the digital pin open we need to make
 use of an internal 20K-ohm resistor to pull up to 5V. This configuration causes
 the input to read HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.

void setup(){

  //configure pin2 as an input and enable the internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
  //configure pin4 as output
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT); 

}

void loop(){
  //read the pin2 state into a variable
  int sensorVal = digitalRead(2);
  
  // Keep in mind the pullup means the pushbutton's
  // logic is inverted. It is HIGH when it's open,
  // and LOW when it's pressed. Turn on pin 4 when the 
  // floormat is stepped on, and off when it's not:
  if (sensorVal == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(4, LOW);
  } 
  else {
    digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
  }
